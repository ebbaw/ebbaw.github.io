                        <p>As part of a course assignment I did a total redesign of UltraGlozz's website and implemented
                            it. Their current website was broken down and analysed, and the new design were prototyped
                            in Adobe XD and then parts were implemented in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

                        <p>Ultraglozz is a danish company producing multi-use polishes and boat accessories. They are
                            selling their products via resellers and on exhibitions, and not on their website. The
                            purpose of their website is give information about their products and upcoming exhibitions,
                            as well as a way for people to contact them. Visit their website <a
                                href="http://ultraglozz.com/">here</a>.</p>
                        <p>This project was done as a part of a course assignment and UltraGlozz has not been a part of the process. However, they have
                            approved me using some of their material in this portfolio.</p>

                        <p>The current web design has several design issues that flaws the experience and overall
                            usability of the website.</p>

                        <p>I created simple wireframes in Adobe XD for desktop and mobile, and a mock-up of the desktop
