                        <p>As part of a course assignment I did a total redesign of UltraGlozz's website and implemented
                            parts if it with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Their current website was broken down and
                            analysed, and the new design were prototyped in Adobe XD. This case focuses on the prototype
                            design.</p>

                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>Ultraglozz is a Danish company producing multi-use polishes and boat accessories. They are
                        selling their products via resellers and on exhibitions, and not on their website. The
                        purpose of their website is give information about their products and upcoming exhibitions,
                        as well as a way for people to contact them. Visit their website <a
                            href="http://ultraglozz.com/">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>This project was done as a part of a course assignment and UltraGlozz has not been a part of the
                        process. However, they have
                        approved me using some of their material in this portfolio.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="problem">
                    <h2>The problem</h2>
                    <p>The current web design has several design issues that flaws the experience and overall
                        usability of the website. Below is their landing page.</p>
                    <img class="border" src="../media/ultraglozz-landing.png"
                        alt="Screenshot of Ultraglozz's landing page">
                    <p class="caption">UltraGlozz's own design</p>
                    <p>There is no obvious part of the landing page that draws the users attention. The header is a big
                        slide show of pictures that takes up room from the products, and the first information we get
                        about the products are small pictures without any explaination. When looking for information
                        about the site and company we get a long quote about money.</p>
                    <p>The newsletter sign-up does not entice interest, nor explains the advantages of signing up. Why
                        should the user submit their e-mail? The latest news on the website are from four years ago, so
                        what can we expect from this newsletter?</p>
                    <p>Moving on to language settings. Flags represent countries and would make sense if one where
                        chosing their region because that would affect the products and/or support. However, in this
                        case it only changes the language and therefore the flags are misleading. Common for the flags
                        and navbar is that the active option is gray, making it look disabled rather than active.</p>
                    <p> UltraGlozz have three polishes and two polish related product, but they have put everything
                        under "Superpolish" which is the name of their most popular polish. If we click "Superpolish" in
                        the navbar, we get a long list of mixed items. The first eight are related to the Superpolish
                        product, and the last four are other products. The hierachry is misleading and makes it
                        difficult to navigate correctly.</p>
                    <img class="border" src="../media/ultraglozz_dropdown.png"
                        alt="Screenshot of dropdown meny when superpolish is clicked in the navbar">
                    <p class="caption">UltraGlozz's own design of the dropdown menu from navbar</p>
                    <p>The items in the dropdown follows us to the product page for UltraGlozz Superpolish, as seen to
                        the left in the screenshot below. However, it does not always contain the same items. The active
                        item looked disabled in the navbar, and this time it looks like an input field. As previously
                        mentioned, the first eight (now nine) items are related to the same product, but the information
                        in them overlap each other. There is no distinct hierachry of the product information and it is
                        not easy to find the information you are looking for.</p>

                    <p>There is much more to say about the current design, but now it is time to move on to my solution!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="solution">
                    <h2>My solution</h2>
                    <p>I delimitated the scope of the project by only focusing on the polish products. This made the
                        purpose of the website much clearer. I created a mock-up in Adobe XD and then implemented parts
                        of the website with plain HTML, CSS and some JavaScript.</p>
                    <img src="../media/ultraglozz_all.png" alt="Mock-up of the new design">
                    <p class="caption">Mock-up of the new design</p>
                </div>
                <div id="process">
                    <h2>The process</h2>
                    <h3>Planning the content</h3>
                    <p>After analysing UltraGlozz's own design, I made a plan for the new design. My main goal of the
                        new design was to make the content easy to understand and the navigation intuitive. I wrote down
                        what pages I wanted in the new design and what they should contain.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The navbar will move to the top of the website in order to make more room for the page
                            content. It will contain seven items: the logo, five pages, and language settings. The pages
                            reachable from the navbar will be Home, Products, Resellers, Exhibitions and Support. Many
                            modern websites do not have a Home button, but instead use the logo as the link to Home.
                            However, since UltraGlozz has older consumers, I chose to have a Home link in the navbar so
                            it will be easy to find.</li>
                        <li>The home page should make the user understand what the company does rigth away. It will
                            focus
                            on their main product: UltraGlozz Superpolish, but also show that they have other polishes
                            as well. I also want the user to get intrigued, so I want a Call to Action taking the user
                            to the UltraGlozz Superpolish product page.</li>
                        <li>A problem in the current website is that it is difficult to get a overview of their polishes
                            and understand the difference between them. On the product page I want to make it easy to
                            find all polishes and compare them.</li>
                        <li>On the product page for a single product, the user should be able the find the information
                            they are looking for in no time. There should be an intro with a product summary, and if the
                            user want to learn more they can scroll to learn more.</li>
                        <li>When the user is looking for a place to buy a product from UltraGlozz, they should be able
                            to
                            search for companies and/or locations. This will be a function on the reseller page.</li>
                        <li>On the exhibition page the user can find upcoming exhibitions.</li>
                        <li>The support page will be a place where the user can find all documentation and FAQ's for
                            their products, and also contact the company.</li>
                        <li>The newletter will be moved to the footer, together with company info and social medias.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Paper sketches</h3>
                    <p>Before starting in Adobe XD I did some quick sketches on paper, just to have some reference on
                        what the designs should contain.</p>
                    <div class="grid" id="paper">
                        <img class="img-shadow" src="../media/ultraglozz-paper-1.png" alt="Paper prototype">
                        <img class="img-shadow" src="../media/ultraglozz-paper-2.png" alt="Paper prototype">
                        <img class="img-shadow" src="../media/ultraglozz-paper-3.png" alt="Paper prototype">
                    </div>
                    <p class="caption">Paper sketches</p>

                    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                    <p>The next step was to make wireframes. This was made in Adobe XD. I also made mobile versions but
                        below I only show the desktop versions.</p>
                    <div class="grid" id="wireframe">
                        <div>
                            <img class="img-shadow" src="../media/ultraglozz-wireframe-home.png"

                    </div>
                    <p class="caption">Wireframes</p>

                    <h3>Fonts and colors</h3>
                    <p>UltraGlozz's color is red, and therefore the website will have a red primary color (something I
                        will talk about again in the discussion). The strong color will be complemented with neutral
                        colors. I want a modern and simple look of the website, and the texts should be easy to read. I
                        chose Open Sans as font because it is modern and a bit playful, but without being unserious.
                        Below is the font sizes I went with in the mock-up, but this how well the font with size 80 px
                        went when I implemented the design will be discussed later...</p>

                    <h2>The result</h2>
                    <h3>Home page</h3>
                    <p>The scrollable home page makes it effortless for the user to get more information and allows more
                        and intriguing paths leading to other pages. It is obvious what the company does and the user
                        are immediately introduced to their best selling product. The language settings now focus on the
                        language rather than countries. The buttons no longer have any corner radius, to give the
                        website a more serious feeling. The footer is not designed yet.</p>

                    <h3>Products page</h3>
                    <p>The products page has gotten a new look since the wireframes. Now it is easier for the user to
                        compare the products and understand what differs between them.</p>
                    <img src="../media/ultraglozz-result-products.png" alt="Mock-up of products page"

                    <h3>Single product page</h3>
                    <p>The page for a single product begins with a summary and some quick facts. If the user scroll on
                        they can read about the usages of the product. They also get both a video and a written step by
                        step guide on how to use it. If the user wants to learn even more, they can navigate between the
                        tabs with FAQs, detailed intructions of use and product specification. By now they probably
                        wonder where they can get this product, and then they see the reseller section with featured
                        companies.</p>

                    <h3>Resellers page</h3>
                    <p>The user can serach for companies or locations and get suggestions of resellers. They can also
                        quick search by using "find nearest" and location services.</p>

                    <h3>Support page</h3>
                    <p>On the support page the user can find FAQs, product documentation and contact info. The FAQs
                        showing here are only placeholders. It is supposed to be both general and product specific
                        questions. Placing the contact info on the bottom of the page makes the user more likely to find
                        their answer in some of the tabs first. However, there is a button on the top of the page that

                    <h2>Discussion and lessons learnt</h2>
                    <p>This was the first website I designed and actually implemented. The first thing I noticed when I
                        started coding and actually seeing the design in a browser was the font sizes. The gap from 17
                        to 80px was huge and made the design feel inconsistent. For example, the step by step guide
                        under the instructions video has a very small font size compared to the rest of the design. When
                        implementing the design, I made the largest fonts smaller. The artboards in Adobe XD were 1920px
                        wide, which made me believe I hade much more space than you actually have on most devices.</p>
                    <p>The main color of the website is red. This is the company's main color, so it makes sense to use
                        it, but at the same time it is a color that is associated with warnings. It would probably make
                        the website friendlier if more neutral colors were used.</p>
                    <p>If I had more time working on the design I would spend most of it on the products and single
                        product page. The accessories section feels a bit awkwardly placed. I would also redesign the
                        cars,boats and home sections on the single product page, making it look less graphical and
                        instead more technical.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The new design has a modern look that is easy to navigate in. My goal was to make is easy for the
                        users to understand the purpose of the company and their products, which I think I succeeded
                        with. However, this was my first webdesign that I actually implemented, and I made many rookie
                        mistakes that I learnt from.</p>
