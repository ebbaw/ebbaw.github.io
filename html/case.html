                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>This project started as a course project in Database Technology and webbased systems, but is now
                        something that my teammates and I work on on our freetime. The originial application was built
                        with Codeigniter, but is now being rebuilt with React, Node.js and Express. The application is
                        getting a total makeover visually as the current one was built with full focus on the backend,
                        and therefore this case do not include any screenshots of the GUI. This project will be updated
                        when the new version comes live.</p>

                    <h2>The problem</h2>
                    <p>There are plenty of party games out there, but many has the sole purpose to get drunk, or require
                        so much focus on the game that you hang out with the game more than with each other. We wanted
                        to create a game that created fun and interesting discussions.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="solution">
                    <h2>Our solution</h2>
                    <p>Our product is a simple quiz app, but without any right or wrong answers. Every question is about
                        personal preferences or opinions. The user choses one of four categories to start the game and
                        is then presented with one question at a time. The questions range from "Do you believe in life
                        after death" to "Do you fold or crumple your toilet paper?" and the user always have two answers
                        to chose between. They can also skip the question. After answering they can see how others have
                        answered. This makes it possible for further discussion. If the user just want to browse others
                        opinions without playing the game, they can chose to list all questions. In this view, they can
                        search, sort and filter all questions.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the public website, we also built an admin page where we can sign in to add, edit and
                        delete questions.</p>
                        <p>The application was named "tottot", where "tot" is a abbreviation of "this or that".</p>

                    <h2>The process</h2>
                    <p>This project was the first database project any of us had done, and neither one of us had much experience in web development. We had to use a MVC structure and heard about Codeigniter, so that was what we chose to use.</p>
                    <p>Before any code was written, we brainstormed and designed the structure of the application and the database. We began with the database containing all questions, modes (categories) and admin users.</p>

                    <p class="caption">ER-schema of tottot database</p>
                    <p>We also made some sketches of flow diagrams on how the user where to interact with the application.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The final product is a fully functional application, but since we made this as beginner web developers it does have some flaws. The security regaring sessions could be improved, as could the general logic and flow of the game. After learning more about the development tools out there, we came to the conclusion that Codeigniter is not the one we want to use.</p>
